<h1>Colonization Clone</h1>

(v0.2.0 preview)

<p>This game is in early version and is not "playable" yet. For keybindings see <a href="https://github.com/institution/cc94/blob/master/README.md">README</a>.</p>

<p>This game uses some graphics from the original Colonization game. To use it you must own "Sid Meier's Colonization" game (from 1994). You can buy one at <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/sid_meiers_colonization">gog.com</a>.</p>

<p>This version was tested on Firefox 40.0.2 </p>

<div><input type="checkbox" id="yesihave"/><label for="yesihave" id="label">I own "Sid Meier's Colonization"</label></div>

<input type="button" value="Continue" onclick="if (document.getElementById('yesihave').checked) { location.assign('cc94.html');} else { document.getElementById('label').style.color = 'red';} " />
